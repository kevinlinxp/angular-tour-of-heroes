      We can both display and change the heroâ€™s name after adding a two-way
      data binding to the <input> element using the built-in ngModel
      directive.

      The ngModel directive also propagates changes to every other binding of
      the hero.name.

      Angular processes all data bindings once per JavaScript event cycle, from
      the root of the application component tree through all child components.
